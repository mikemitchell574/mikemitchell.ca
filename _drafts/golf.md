Ideas:
1. How to lower your golf handicap
2. How to improve at golf (too vague?)

The issue with "How to lower your golf handicap" is that there are ways to lower one's handicap without improving at golf in general. The first thing that comes to mind is playing the same course over and over again.

You could say "How to lower your average golf score" but then again you could just play the same course over and over. Better might be "How to lower your average golf score regardless of course". But that sounds clunky.

Some aspects that I'm circling:
- The differentiation between biomechanics and motor learning. The former seems to be about how the body moves, while the latter is about learning how to move the body.
- The importance of external vs. internal focus of attention. It seems like to perfect the execution of an actual shot, we are better served to focus on external thing(s). But there must be some realm of training through which an internal focus has a benefit?
- Also, the different between proximal and distal areas of internal focus.
- The overall import of club head velocity and position. These seem to be the most important factor in terms of where the ball ultimately travels.
- The importance of "task-relevant information" as more important overall than external vs. internal foci. (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00222895.2022.2122920#d1e302)
- Quiet Eye (QE) training: the idea that looking at the back of the ball for 2-3 seconds before initiating the swing provides better results. (Full-swing and putting?) There is another suggestion in the research that looking at the *target* for 2-3 seconds while putting fits the definition of QE. Will need to explore further.
- One study suggested that participants performed better in a putting exercise when they perceived the whole as larger. (https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797611428810)
