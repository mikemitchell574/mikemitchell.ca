Ideas:
1. How to lower your golf handicap
2. How to improve at golf (too vague?)
   

The issue with "How to lower your golf handicap" is that there are ways to lower one's handicap without improving at golf in general. The first thing that comes to mind is playing the same course over and over again.

You could say "How to lower your average golf score" but then again you could just play the same course over and over. Better might be "How to lower your average golf score regardless of course". But that sounds clunky.

Another note on this from the literature: there are important distinctions to be made between average score (actual) and (adjusted). There are factors like weather and course condition that affect average score!

Some aspects that I'm circling:
- The differentiation between biomechanics and motor learning. The former seems to be about how the body moves, while the latter is about learning how to move the body.
- The importance of external vs. internal focus of attention. It seems like to perfect the execution of an actual shot, we are better served to focus on external thing(s). But there must be some realm of training through which an internal focus has a benefit?
- Also, the different between proximal and distal areas of internal focus.
- The overall import of club head velocity and position. These seem to be the most important factor in terms of where the ball ultimately travels.
- The importance of "task-relevant information" as more important overall than external vs. internal foci. (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00222895.2022.2122920#d1e302)
- Quiet Eye (QE) training: the idea that looking at the back of the ball for 2-3 seconds before initiating the swing provides better results. (Full-swing and putting?) There is another suggestion in the research that looking at the *target* for 2-3 seconds while putting fits the definition of QE. Will need to explore further.
- One study suggested that participants performed better in a putting exercise when they perceived the whole as larger. (https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797611428810)

Something that I noticed again at the simulator today (2025-07-30) was the clubface often flying open after impact. Digging around with Claude, it suggested a stronger grip at address. In this case stronger means the hands more turned to the right, with more knuckles of the left hand visible at address. Will look to try it.
Update on above: thought about it a bit, and figured that a stronger grip likely wouldn't actually change what happens as the ball is impacted. Reprompted Claude and it just suggested holding the club more firmly, which is what I originally thought. But then I thought about how I very likely am already gripping the club very hard! I re-prompted Claude again and it suggested that I loosen my grip strength and focus on other aspects of the swing (as I said that I already swing at a high speed).

Something unearthed in the literature as well (can't locate exact source) is that if the impact is off-centre, some momentum 'leaks' into the rotation of the clubface.. so I could just be not hitting the centre of the clubface! Or at least that's another factor here.

There might be something to say regarding both a reddit comment and a magazine drill with regard to grip strength. The reddit comment suggested that the key to one player's ability to square the clubface at impact was due to their focus on the two end fingers on their left hand (the pinky and ring). The magazine drill has one with their right hand only use the index finger to pull up on the grip. When focusing on these three touch points I do find that I'm able to grip the club looser than I normally would while maintaining control over the clubface (at least on the backswing as I practice here in the apartment.)
